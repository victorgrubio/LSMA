##### An introduction to different Data Science engineering concepts and Applications using Python

These series of tutorials on Data Science engineering will try to compare how different concepts in the discipline can be implemented in Python.  

We will do this from a neutral point of view. Our opinion is that each environment has good and bad things, and any data scientist should know how to use both in order to be as prepared as posible for job market or to start personal project.    

This Series of tutorials will go hands-on into how to actually perform different data science taks such as working with data frames, doing aggregations, or creating different statistical models such in the areas of supervised and unsupervised learning.  

We will use real-world datasets, and we will build some real data products. This will help us to quickly transfer what we learn here to actual data analysis situations.  

## Tutorials

This is a growing list of tutorials explaining concepts and applications in Python.

### [Introduction to Data Frames]

An introduction to the basic data structure and how to use it in Python/Pandas.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis]

About this important task in any data science engineering project.  

### [Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering]
About using Principal Component Analysis and k-means Clustering to better represent and understand our data.
